# 🔒 PhishShield: AI-Powered Phishing Website Detection System  

PhishShield is a **machine learning-based system** designed to detect phishing websites with **92% accuracy**. Leveraging advanced feature engineering and the **Random Forest algorithm**, this project enables real-time classification of URLs to protect users from malicious websites.  

---

## 🚀 **Features**  
- **Real-Time Detection**: Instantly classify URLs as phishing or legitimate.  
- **Advanced Feature Engineering**: Extracts 20+ features from URLs, including domain age, SSL status, and suspicious keywords.  
- **High Accuracy**: Achieves **92% accuracy** using the Random Forest model.  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Deployed as a **Flask web application** for seamless user interaction.  

---

## 🛠️ **Technologies Used**  
- **Programming Languages**: Python  
- **Libraries/Frameworks**: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Flask  
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Git, Heroku  

---

## 📊 **Performance Metrics**  
- **Accuracy**: 92%  
- **Precision**: 91%  
- **Recall**: 93%  
- **False Positives Reduced by**: 15%  

---

## 🎯 **Key Contributions**  
- Collected and preprocessed **10,000+ URLs** from PhishTank and UCI datasets.  
- Engineered **20+ features** to capture phishing patterns.  
- Trained and optimized the **Random Forest model** using hyperparameter tuning.  
- Deployed the model as a **Flask web app** for real-time phishing detection.
